# salesRepQuotas

This exercise demonstrates your competency in the skills learned in this module. You must complete this exercise on your own, without any help from an instructor or another student. If you get stuck, go back through the relevant sections in the book, the quizzes, and the assignments for this module -- everything you need to do in this exercise has been covered in this module.

These are the skills you practiced in this and previous modules and will now demonstrate:

Reading and writing files
Using structs
 

Module 2 Competency Exercise: Sales Rep Quotas

Create a project that writes data to a binary file about sales reps. That data is a struct for each sales rep, containing first name, last name, quota, and quarterly sales for 4 quarters. In a loop, ask the user for the information for 3 sales reps and write each one to the binary file. Next, read data from that binary file. For each sales rep, add up the quarterly sales and compare that total to the quota for that sales rep; report if they made the quota or not. Add all the quarterly sales -- add the sales for Q1 from all of the sales reps, add the sales for Q2 from all of the sales reps, etc. Display the total quarterly sales and the total of all sales.

Here is what the result should look like:

Take a screenshot of the result that matches this example.

 

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
